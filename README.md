## Overview

This Java program demonstrates the basic concepts of a blockchain:

- Creation of blocks containing data.
- Hashing of block data using SHA-512 algorithm.
- Linking blocks together using previous hash references.
- Displaying block contents and details.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:

2: Print the contents of the most recent block.
3: Print the contents of the entire blockchain.
4: Exit the program.
# Technologies Used
Java: Programming language used for the implementation.
SHA-512: Hashing algorithm used to secure block data.
LocalDateTime and DateTimeFormatter: Java classes for managing timestamps.
